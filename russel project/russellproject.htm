<h1>My Favorite Dragon Ball Characters</h1>

<h2>#1 Whis</h2>

<img src=whis.jpg alt=Whis style="float:left;width:220px;height:220px;">

<div>
<p>Whis is an angel in the Dragon Ball universe, who has been ordered by the Grand Priest, the most powerful angel in the multiverse, to guide Lord Beerus, the God of Destruction of universe 7. Whis never demenstrates his obscene power in the show, but trains Goku and Vegeta and in their training, Goku or Vegeta could not lay a finger on him. </p>

<p>Whis only comes to Earth because he is in love with Earth's culinary feats, as is Lord Beerus. In fact, it is for Earth's culinary feats why Earth has not been destroyed by Lord Beerus.</p>
<p>You can see Whis being the foodie that he is when he tries Earth's ramen for the first time <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9Xh_YImMKo&t=7s>here</a>
<pre>Whis is the son of the Grand Priest as well, who is supposedly the strongest being in the 
multiverse next to Grand Zeno. </pre>

<h2>#2 Tien Shinhan</h2>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLOJZaNuS0">
<img src=tien.jpg alt=Tien style="float:left;width:220px;height:220px;">
</a>

<div>
<p>From the original Dragon Ball to Dragon Ball Z, Tien has been one on the strongest and most interesting characters in the whole franchise. At one point he was even the second strongest character in the whole show for a very long time before Piccolo showed up. His third eye is supposed to mean what it means metaphorically; Tien has opened his third eye, allowing him to see his opponent's every move.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, on the release of Dragon Ball Super, Tien was completely and utterly dropped as a character and got a grand total of 11 lines in the entire 131 episode series, and even less show times. His greatest moment is <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tL58NYANps>this</a>, when Tien stalled against Cell for Goku's arrival.</p>
<p><b>Tien also has a best friend named Chiaotzu, a very mysterious and unexplained character who was dropped even harder than Tien, with only one showing in the entirety of Dragon Ball Super.</b></p>

<h2>#3 Piccolo</h2>

<img src=piccolo.png alt=Piccolo style="float:left;width:220px;height:220px;">

<div>
<p>Piccolo was one of the first character's in the Dragon Ball series, revealed when Goku was just a kid, as Piccolo Diamo. He was originally the evil heart of Kami, the god of Earth at the time, and was set on conquering the Earth. Goku thankfully bested him and killed Piccolo Diamo. But just before his death, Piccolo shot a huge egg from his throat into the distance, which was the soon to come Piccolo. This new Piccolo was meant to conquer the Earth as well, but after being defeated by Goku a second time, Piccolo began to fall in love with Earth despite his mean attitude and made best friends and even trained Goku's son, Gohan. Now Piccolo is one of the fiercest protectors of the Earth.</p>

<p>Like Tien unfortunately, Piccolo is entirely dropped as a character in Dragon Ball Super, but does get more lines and showtime than Tien. His greatest moment as a character is when he fused with Nail and took on Frieza for the first time, putting up a good fight. Watch <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJzH_65NJ3I>here</a></p>
